            <h2>Text to speech and speech to text</h2>
            <p>Speech to text and text to speech software are useful tools for making programming more accessible.  
                Speech to text software takes vocal input from the user and turns it into text on the computer.  Text to 
                speech does the opposite, taking text from the computer and outputting it as audio.  Speech to text
                can help a student who is not able to type for whatever reason.  Text to speech can help students
                who are not able to read text.  Both kinds of software are widely available, some IDE's have TTS and STT
                plugins available, VSCode definitely does.  If you are using a web based IDE most browsers have 
                TTS extensions available.
            </p>

            <h2>Hardware</h2>
            <p>For students that have some physical disability that makes using a computer difficult there 
                may be a hardware solution that can help them.  Here are some examples:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Braille keyboards:  Keyboards that have Braille keys which allow someone who understands
                        Braille to read the keys by touch.  There are also Braille displays which can be used to 
                        read text from the computer..
                    </li>
                    <li>Eye tracking:  With the right software and hardware you can use your eyes to control a computer</li>
                    <li>Adaptive Keyboards:  Many special keyboards are made for people who have issues using a standard one.  
                        For example, a larger keyboard with depressed buttons for people who have muscle control issues.
                    </li>
                    <li>Foot switches: Allow a person to use their feet to control a computer.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>This is just a small sample of the accessibility tools available.  <a href="https://business.scope.org.uk/assistive-technology-devices-definitions-how-disabled-people-use-the-web/" target="_blank">
                This article contains a nice summary of the kinds of tools that are out there.
