				<h2>Encouragement and a growth mindset</h2>
				<p>Many students can be intimidated by computer science. It requires you to learn a lot upfront and
					your prior knowledge will not help you that much. Many students can struggle at the outset, that
					struggle can easily lead to students feeling frustrated and, eventually, concluding that they
					will never understand this subject. This issue is compounded by the fact that if you make a very
					small mistake while programming the whole project will not work, and finding that small mistake can
					be challenging as well. As a teacher you need to be encouraging, always point out that mistakes and
					bug fixing are issues that ALL programmers deal with. There is nothing wrong with them it is just
					the nature of the business. You can help encourage students by instilling a growth mindset in them.
					A growth mindset just means that students believe that they will improve through practice and work.
					Remind students that no one came out of the womb knowing how to program, that skill was obtained
					through practice.

				<h2>Use visuals</h2>
				<p>Most concepts in computer science are abstract, they can be hard to understand through just
					verbal or written descriptions. Visual aids are absolutely critical. Use flowcharts to
					describe conditionals and loops. Use animated images to show how algorithms manipulate a
					data set. Use charts and diagrams to describe the architecture of a computer or a network.
					These things will greatly help your students in understanding some of the more complicated
					concepts in computer science.

				<h2>Analyze existing code</h2>
				<p>When teaching someone how to do something it is really useful to show them an example
					of that technique used well. Show students examples of good code using the concepts
					you are currently studying and have them analyze. Ask them to identify the techniques
					used and why they were used. Using this in conjunction with other techniques will help
					deepen their understanding. You can also use examples of bad code, have them analyze a code
					segment and find the errors. This will help them anticipate and avoid those same errors when
					they write their own code.

				<h2>Collaboration and pair programming</h2>
				<p>Collaboration is a powerful learning tool in any subject. When students work together they are able
					to learn from each other. The trouble in computer science is that the logistics of having multiple
					students working on one project can be challenging. In an advanced class you may be able to
					teach them how to use version control and facilitate group projects in that way. However, in most
					high school and below classrooms this will not be practical. Some online environment have very
					nice collaborative tools (CMU CS academy stands out here in my experience). For most situations
					the solution is pair programming. This is the practice of having two students work at one
					computer, one observes while the other types. Every few minutes they switch spots. When done well
					this allows two students to work very closely together on one project. I would advise not using
					this technique for very long projects, this technique can work well for one, maybe two class
					periods in a row, but longer than that and students can start to chafe at it, especially if there
					is a knowledge imbalance or a personality clash.

				<h2>Using documentation</h2>
				<p>Programmers are always looking things up. No programmer actively tries to memorize all of the methods
					in Java's String class, for example. If you need to know something you don't use all the time you
					look it up in the documentation. It is important that students also learn how to do this and that
					doing so is perfectly normal and not "cheating" in any way. When students ask about something that
					could be found in the documentation, rather than answering them directly have them look it up
					themselves. If possible, I would also encourage making the documentation available during any exams
					to further normalize looking things up.

				<h2>Hands on</h2>
				<p>There is no substitute for hands on experience when it comes to programming. No matter what
					other techniques you use most class time should be taken up by students writing their own code.
					Make sure to give them projects that force them to use the concept you are learning and then let
					them go to work. It is through this process that an abstract concept becomes a concrete technique
					that students can then use whenever they need to.
