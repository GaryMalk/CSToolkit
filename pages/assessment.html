				<h2>Formative Assessments</h2>
				<p>Having good formative assessments is a crucial component of any classroom. With formative
					assessments the emphasis is on giving students quick, timely, actionable feedback. Good
					formative assessments are not necessarily about giving a grade but helping students learn.

				<h2>Peer Review</h2>
				<p>When designing a project build in a peer review component. Peer review helps students
					by not only facilitating them receiving feedback but also by putting them in a position
					to give feedback. Having to give someone else feedback forces you to think critically
					about the assignment and may help students look at their own work in a new light. Students
					may need guidance on how to give feedback so it is a good idea to structure this activity
					by using a worksheet or form that guides students on what to look for when evaluating peer
					work.

				<h2>Circulation</h2>
				<p>When students are working on projects the teacher can accomplish a lot by circulating
					around the classroom, observing students, and offering feedback where needed. Try to look
					out for students who are stuck, struggling, or taking the wrong approach and give them
					feedback to help them find their way to the correct path. This way you can give students
					quick, frequent feedback even if they are working on a long form project.

				<h2>Entry Tasks and Exit Tickets</h2>
				<p>Entry tasks and exit tickets are a good practice in general for setting up a strong classroom
					routine. They also give you an opportunity for a quick formative assessment at the beginning or
					end of a class. For entry tasks ask a simple review question from a previous lesson. Exit tasks
					let you reflect on what was learned in the lesson that day. For both it is important to make
					these quick for students and quick for you to assess as well.

				<h2>Rubrics</h2>
				<p>Any project you have the students work on should include a rubric. Rubrics help students
					assess their own work and understand what they need to include. Rubrics can include
					sections on the coding concepts you want the students to focus on, good coding practices
					you want students to follow, and anything else you want to empahsize.
