    <h1>Lesson: Image Formats for Use in HTML</h1>

    <h2>Image File Types / Brief History</h2>
    <p>Study this lesson and then take the quiz: Image Formats for Use in HTML.</p>
    <h3><strong>BMP (Bitmap)</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Creation: Developed by Microsoft in the 1987 for Windows 2.0&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Characteristics: Stores images in a raw, uncompressed, lossless format, resulting in
            high quality but very large file sizes.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Use: Historically used as a default for Windows, it's now less common due to its
            inefficiency for web use.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>BMP is short for bitmap, because that's literally what it is: a raw map of all the pixels in the image. It has no
        compression. It is is&nbsp;<em>lossless</em> which means it preserves the image 100%. This also means that the
        files sizes are huge, which made it impractical for use on the Internet.</p>
    <h3><strong>ICO (Icon) </strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Creation: Developed by Microsoft in the 1987 for Windows 2.0&nbsp;</li>
        <li>ICO has exactly the same format as BMP. Icon files are typically 16&times;16, 32&times;32, 48&times;48, or
            256&times;256 pixels. You convert a BMP file to ICO simply by resizing it and renaming it to have the ico
            extension instead of bmp. You can then use the icon for what is known as a&nbsp;<em>favicon</em>. That is
            the icon displayed in the browser title bar of your website by putting a link like this in the head section:
            <code>&lt;link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/favicon.ico"&gt;</code>. Read the details
            here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_favicon.asp" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener">https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_favicon.asp</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Creation: Invented by Steve Wilhite in 1987.</li>
        <li>Best for: Simple animations, images with a limited color palette (up to 256 colors),
            and small icons.</li>
        <li>Characteristics: Supports animation and basic
            transparency.&nbsp;Its limited color palette makes it less
            suitable for photographs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>GIFs are still very popular for simple graphics and animations. Animated photos can look pixelated when you zoom
        in. While they support transparency, they don't support transparency in animation. They have large file sizes
        compared to the content they deliver, so are not efficient. Modern alternatives that support transparency and
        animation include APNG (multi-image PNG), WebP, and AVIF.</p>
    <h3><strong>JPEG / JPG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Creation: The standard was introduced in 1992.</li>
        <li>Best for: Photographs and images with continuous tones and complex color variations.
            The most widely used image format for digital photography and web use.</li>
        <li>Characteristics: Uses lossy compression, which
            means some data is discarded during compression to achieve smaller file sizes.&nbsp;This can lead to a
            slight loss of quality, but it's generally
            unnoticeable in photographs.&nbsp;Does not support
            transparency.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>PNG (Portable Network Graphics):</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Creation:&nbsp;PNG was created in 1995 by the PNG Development Group as a replacement / improvement over GIF
            for static images: better compression, full color, transparency, no patent encumbrances.</li>
        <li>PNG did <strong>not</strong> originally support animation (though later APNG etc fixed that).</li>
        <li>Best for:&nbsp;Images requiring transparency (e.g., logos, icons, graphics with sharp edges), and images
            with fewer colors.</li>
        <li>Characteristics:&nbsp;Uses lossless compression, preserving all image data and ensuring high
            quality.&nbsp;Supports alpha transparency, allowing for varying levels of opacity.&nbsp;File sizes can be
            larger than JPEGs for complex images.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="display: inline-block; width: 85%; height: fit-content;"><strong>APNG</strong> is the same format as PNG
        and the same file extension, "png", but it contains multiple PNG images for animation. A browser which does not
        understand APNG would simply show the first PNG frame as a static image.</p>
    <img style="float: right; width: 15%; max-width: 125px; min-width: 40px; height: fit-content; position: relative; top: -40px; padding-right: 5%; margin-right: 3%;"
        src="../images/Animated_PNG_example_bouncing_beach_ball.png" alt="animated bouncing ball in APNG format" />
    <p><strong style="font-size: 18px;">SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Creation: World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) first created in 2001</li>
        <li>Best for:&nbsp;Diagrams, icons, logos, and illustrations that need to scale without losing quality.</li>
        <li>Characteristics:&nbsp;A vector format, meaning images are defined by mathematical equations rather than
            pixels.&nbsp;This allows for infinite scalability without pixelation.&nbsp;Can be embedded directly into
            HTML or used as an external file.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>WebP (Web Picture format):</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Creation: WebP (from Google), introduced around 2010, intended to combine advantages of JPEG, PNG, GIF
            (lossy, lossless, transparency, animation) with better compression.</li>
        <li>Best for:&nbsp;Both still images and animated images, offering superior compression compared to JPEG and PNG
            while maintaining quality.</li>
        <li>Characteristics:&nbsp;Supports both lossy and lossless compression, as well as transparency and
            animation.&nbsp;Offers smaller file sizes and faster loading times.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>AVIF (AV1 Image File Format):</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Creation: Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia) finalized the first version in 2019.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Best for:&nbsp;High-performance images and animated images, providing excellent compression and quality.
        </li>
        <li>Characteristics: A newer format offering even better compression efficiency than WebP. Supports transparency
            and animation. It uses the AV1 codec (for high compression efficiency) stored in a HEIF container. It
            supports both lossy &amp; lossless, good color depths, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong style="font-family: inherit;">Choosing the Right Format:</strong></span>
    </h3>
    <div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Photographs:</strong>&nbsp;JPEG or WebP (for better compression).</li>
                <li><strong>Logos, Icons, Graphics with Transparency:</strong>&nbsp;PNG, SVG, or WebP.</li>
                <li><strong>Animations:</strong>&nbsp;GIF (for simple animations), WebP, or AVIF.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalable Graphics:</strong>&nbsp;SVG.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>JPG, GIF, and PNG are the still the most common formats on the
                Internet, however modern formats WebP and AVIF with superior compression, quality, and features are
                growing in popularity.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts and Technical Terms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Raster vs vector</strong>: Raster images are pixel-based (like JPG, PNG), vector are
                geometry/path based (SVG). Raster are limited by resolution; vector scale nicely.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Lossy vs lossless compression</strong>: Lossy = some data / detail discarded to reduce file size
                (JPEG lossy, WebP lossy, AVIF lossy versions). Lossless = image is represented without losing
                information (PNG, lossless WebP, lossless AVIF).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Color depth</strong>: Number of bits per pixel / per channel (8-bit per channel, 10/12/16 bits,
                etc), how many colors can be represented, also whether color space / gamut / HDR etc are supported.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Transparency / Alpha channel</strong>: Whether pixels can be partially transparent (e.g. PNG,
                WebP, AVIF) vs only fully on/off or none.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px;">An alpha channel is&nbsp;<mark class="QVRyCf">an additional data layer in digital
            images and videos that provides transparency information, controlling how opaque or transparent each pixel
            is</mark>.&nbsp;Represented as a grayscale mask, it determines whether parts of the image are fully visible,
        fully transparent (invisible), or partially see-through, allowing for effects like compositing, layering, and
        special effects by blending with other images or backgrounds.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Animation</strong>: Some formats support multiple frames. GIF has long supported, APNG adds that
                for PNG‐based images, WebP/AVIF have animation support in many cases.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Compression artifacts</strong>: Lossy compression can introduce blur, blockiness, color banding,
                especially with sharp transitions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Progressive rendering / interlacing</strong>: Some image formats support progressive loading
                (e.g. JPEG progressive, interlaced PNG) so that a low resolution or coarse version appears quickly and
                then refines.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Browser support</strong>: Not all browsers support all formats or all features of each format
                (e.g. animation, lossless WebP, AVIF etc).</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The &lt;picture&gt; element and Fallback Images</h2>
    <p>Most images are linked to HTML pages by using the <code>img</code> element, like so:</p>
    <p><span class="tagnamecolor" style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;"><span class="tagcolor"><span
                    class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span><span style="color: #9242b4;">img
                    </span><span class="token attr-name" style="color: #03893d;">src</span><span
                        class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span
                            class="token punctuation">"</span>img/img_orange_flowers.jpg<span
                            class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token attr-name"
                        style="color: #03893d;">alt</span><span class="token attr-value"><span
                            class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span
                            class="token punctuation">"</span>flowers<span
                            class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span
                        class="token punctuation">/&gt;</span></span></span></span></p>
    <p>where the attribute <code>src</code> contains the path to the image file and <code>alt</code> contains a text
        description of the image for accessiblity screen readers.</p>
    <p>However, HTML5 introduced the <code>picture</code> element for responsive design, allowing developers to provide
        different image sources. The <code>picture</code> element is formatted like so, to accommodate screens that have
        different widths:</p>
    <p><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;"><span class="token tag"><span
                    class="token punctuation">&lt;</span><span style="color: #9242b4;">picture</span><span

    <p>If the available width is too small to accommodate a 650px image, it will fallback to display the 465px image
        instead. If the screen is too small to display even that, it will display the default jpg at the bottom. Try
        this out yourself at W3Schools: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_picture"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_picture</a>.
        Resize the window to see the image change.</p>
    <p>You could, of course, use styling to resize a picture dynamically to a percentage of the screen, such as 20% of
        the width. But resizing happens in the client browser&nbsp;<em>after</em> the entire file has been downloaded.
        Your website will load faster if you don't force the client to waste time downloading images that are larger
        than it can display, when it could have selected a smaller image instead.</p>
    <p>Fallback images can also accommodate browsers that don't support the newest file formats. A developer can support
        those that do while still providing images for those that don't:</p>

    <p>A browser that supports the picture element will first attempt to load the first image, which in this case is
        AVIF, specified by the <code>source</code> element. If it doesn't understand the format, it will drop to the
        second option, which is WebP. Finally, it will drop to the last option on the list, which is a JPEG, which all
        browers support. If the browser is very old and doesn't even know what the <code>picture</code> element is, it
        will ignore the outer tag but still load the JPEG file because that is in an <code>img</code> element. For this
        reason, an <code>img</code> element with a safe format like JPEG should always be the final fallback option.
        There should <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only be one</span> <code>img</code> element in the
        <code>picture</code> element, because a browser that doesn't understand <code>picture</code> will display all
        <code>img</code> elements. The <code>alt</code> attribute on the <code>img</code> tag will be used as the
        alternate text for whichever picture is displayed, which is why there is no alternative text on the
        <code>source</code> elements.

        <li>
            <p><strong>SVG</strong> &ndash; good
                support across modern browsers; older IE versions had quirks; some mobile-browser-versions might have
                minor issues especially in scripting/interaction. But generally very safe now.</p>

                broadly supported in recent major browsers; some older or niche browsers or certain mobile OS versions

            <p><strong>AVIF</strong> &ndash;
                support is rapidly increasing. Major browsers support it. But because it&rsquo;s newer, there may be
                performance / encoding quality variation; fewer tools historically. Fallbacks are wise if audience may
